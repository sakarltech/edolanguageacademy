# Edo Language Academy - Complete Information

## About Us
Edo Language Academy (ELA) is an online platform helping Edo (Bini) children, teens, and adults—especially in the diaspora—to speak, read, and write Edo confidently. We provide a warm, structured, modern online academy that makes Edo easy, fun, and consistent so families keep their heritage alive, together.

## Mission
We reconnect diaspora families with their heritage through structured, engaging online Edo language education. We serve Edo families across the UK, Europe, North America, Nigeria, and around the world.

## Why We Exist
Diaspora families want their children to retain Edo language and identity, but lack structured instruction, materials, and community to foster learning. Parents often cannot teach consistently due to time constraints, pronunciation challenges, or confidence. Schools rarely offer Edo, so children lose fluency and cultural connection.

## Who We Serve
- Kids (5-12 years)
- Teens (13-17 years)
- Adults (18+ years)
